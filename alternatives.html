    <p class="lh-lg w-75">Just because you're under 21 or attending an institution where alcohol is strictly prohibited, it doesn't mean you can't find ways to unwind and de-stress before a big exam. One alternative to drinking is to indulge in some comfort food, such as a warm bowl of soup or a plate of mac and cheese. Another option is to take a break from studying and hang out with friends, whether it's playing board games or watching a movie together. If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a counselor or reaching out to a support group. Remember, there are plenty of healthy and safe alternatives to drinking, and you should never feel pressured to partake in something that makes you uncomfortable.
